Graph-Edt is a small program that allows you to create a square graph with
clickable circles.  When these circles are clicked they create an edge to
adjacent circles.

Dependencies:

python-wxgtk2.8
python2.7

Has only been tested on Debian7.0

Run:

python graph-edt

Test:

python -m unittest graph-edt-test

TODO:

Destory child widgets instead of hiding them.

The problem is that the static text disappears everytime I resize the window.

Change the code to make it more readable and less hacky.
